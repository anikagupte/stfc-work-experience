PROJECT DESCRIPTION
I spent two weeks with the cloud team at STFC programming a project handling pull request metrics in Python. Specifically, this script calculates the average time from the creation to merge of all pull requests in a repository.
This data can be scraped using Prometheus (a time series database) and then exported onto the monitoring service Grafana to create a dynamic dashboard of the metrics.
